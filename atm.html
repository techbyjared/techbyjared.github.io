            <h2>6th Grade</h2>
            <p>6th grade I had learned so many things about computers and typing. I can still remember coming into ATM and barely knowing how to type but after a few months of practice I was getting faster and faster. At this moment I can type 54 wpm. That is my highest but sadely it wasn't when I took a test.</p>

        <h2>7th Grade</h2>
        <p>7th grade I felt way more comfortable in ATM. I felt like I was able to type really fast and had more knowledge about computers.</p>

        <h2> 8th Grade</h2>
        <p>8th grade is so far the best. We get to make a website, I never ever thought to my self lets make a website. I never really had the desire to make a website but now that we have all the these great sites to help practice making a website.</p>
        <p> Reflection: All three years of ATM was the best, I had the best teachers they were so nice a helped me when I needed it. I look forward to doing ATM in highschool. I never would have thought that I would become a master at a computer but now I am and it feels good that you Ms. Milton and Ms. McClure.
