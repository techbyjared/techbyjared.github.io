            <h2>High School Baseball</h2>
            <p>I plan on playing high school baseball all four years. I think that I can make it on the team, but if I don't that tells me that I need to work harder and make the team the next year. I can play anywhere on the field but my main position is second base and pitcher.</p>

        <h2>College Baseball</h2>
        <p>I would love to play baseball in college it is one of my dreams. Getting a scholarship for baseball would mean the world to me. The three colleges I would like to play baseball for are Ole Miss, Long Beach State, and UCLA. My parents if I get a scholarship to one of those schools would be so happy right now I have been playing the game for 10 years and out of those ten years I have learned and seen so much about the game. My dad has been my coach ever since I was about 6 and now his is letting me go into the hands of highschool coaches.</p>

        <h2>Baseball after College</h2>
        <p>I would really like to make it to the MLB (Major League Baseball) because that is a very good career to have you get paid very good money no matter what, if you are playing or if you are sitting the bench. If that doesn't work out I would like to work with my dad as a flood control worker. And if that doesnâ€™t work out I would love to become a fireman.</p>
