        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>I am interested in baseball, I have been playing for about 11 years and now get to go on and play high school baseball. Baseball is everything to me, I was a very good pitcher and second basemen but all of that went down when I fractured my growth plate in my elbow. I lost all of my speed in running, my velocity in pitching, I was out for about 3 or 4 months. 
            I wasn’t able to play couldn’t get stronger, but no all I did was sit at my house and when I had games I would sit the bench and not play, it was very emotional for me because I really love to play baseball and I have never broken or fractured anything in my life and when I finally do I facture it by doing something I love.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I don’t have too many hobbies but during on and off season I really like to fish and play paintball. I have really been into paintball for a couple of years now, at first it was kinda scary but after awhile I was able to get used to the pain and man up. This year I got my one gear and it made me feel like I was more safe because instead of shooting one paintball and some body I get to shoot 20 paintball in a second. I have been fishing for about all my life and it makes me feel better, because when you are outside sitting or standing and its quiet and then you have a fish on and it makes you feel good. It takes your mind off of everything, and takes all of the stress about school or work or whatever it is it.</p>
