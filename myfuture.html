            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p>My high school choices are St John Bosco, Lakewood, and Millikan. These schools are all very good they all provide a very good education and a good sports program. I plan on playing baseball in high school and these schools all have very good baseball teams.</p>

        <h2> Career Interest</h2>
        <p>I would really like to make it to the MLB (Major League Baseball) because that is a very good career to have you get payed very good money no matter what if you are playing or if you are sitting the bench./ If that doesn't work out I would like to work with my dad as a flood control worker. And if that doesnâ€™t work out I would love to become a fireman.</p>
